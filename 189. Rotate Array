Rotate an array of n elements to the right by k steps.

For example, with n = 7 and k = 3, the array [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] is rotated to [5,6,7,1,2,3,4].

Note:
Try to come up as many solutions as you can, there are at least 3 different ways to solve this problem.

Hint:
Could you do it in-place with O(1) extra space?


public class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int length = nums.length;
        if(k>length) k = k%length;

        for(int j = 0;j<k;j++){
        	int num = nums[length-k+j];
 			for(int i = length-k-1+j;i>=j;i--){
        		nums[i+1] = nums[i];
        	}

        	nums[j] = num;
        }
 
    }
}
